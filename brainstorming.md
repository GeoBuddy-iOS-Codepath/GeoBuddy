## Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas
### Geography
   - **Mobile:** The app uses maps and location to show places near the user. The app uses the camera for image-based identification of landmarks.
   - **Story:** The app helps users learn about places around them. The value is clear to users who want quick facts about locations. Friends who like travel or school subjects would respond well.
   - **Market:** The market includes students, tourists, and curious users. The user base can be large because many people explore places. The app gives strong value to people who study geography. The audience is students, teachers, and travelers.
   - **Habit:** Users open the app when they travel or move through new places. Users mostly consume content but can submit location facts.
   - **Scope:** The core scope is map integration and simple fact pages. This can be built with basic map and camera features. A simple version with location facts is still worth building.

### League of Legends
   - **Mobile:** The app uses push notifications for match alerts. The app uses live data to show real-time stats.
   - **Story:** The app helps players track games and progress. The value is clear to players who want updates fast. Friends who play the game would respond well.
   - **Market:** The market is the global League of Legends player base. The user base is large because many people play. The app gives strong value to players who track stats. The audience is well-defined: active players.
   - **Habit:** Users open the app before and after matches. Users consume stats but can also create builds or notes.
   - **Scope:** The scope is match history, alerts, and build tools. Data integration is the main challenge. A simple version with match history is still useful.

The product features are clear and focused.

### Board Game
   - **Mobile:** The app uses the camera to read game pieces or boards. The app uses audio to guide play or explain rules.
   - **Story:** The app helps players learn and manage board games. The value is clear for people who want rule support. Friends who play board games would respond well.
   - **Market:** The market includes hobby players and game groups. The user base is medium but loyal. The app gives strong value to people who teach games. The audience is board game players and meetup groups.
   - **Habit:** Users open the app each time they start a game session. Users consume rules but can also create house rule sets.
   - **Scope:** The scope is rule lookup, camera detection, and helpers. Camera reading may be complex but core features are simple. A basic version with rule search is still good to ship. The product is well-defined with clear use cases.

## Final Idea
We've decided to go with the **GEOGRAPHY APP**!
